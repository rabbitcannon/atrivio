# Key Concepts

Understanding these core concepts will help you get the most out of Atrivio.

## Organizations

An **organization** is your business entity in Atrivio. It's the top-level container for everything else.

- One organization = one business
- Contains attractions, staff, tickets, settings
- Has its own Stripe account for payments
- Has its own storefront for selling tickets

## Attractions

An **attraction** is a specific experience within your organization. Examples:

- A haunted house
- An escape room
- A corn maze
- A hayride

Each attraction can have:
- Its own ticket types and pricing
- Capacity limits
- Operating schedules
- Check-in stations

## Staff & Roles

**Staff members** are people who work at your organization. Each staff member has a **role** that determines what they can do:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Created the organization, full control |
| **Admin** | Manages everything except deleting the org |
| **Manager** | Day-to-day operations |
| **HR** | Staff management and time tracking |
| **Finance** | Financial reports and payouts |
| **Box Office** | Ticket sales and check-in |
| **Actor** | Performers who clock in/out |
| **Scanner** | Check-in only |

## Time Tracking

The **time clock** lets staff members:
- Clock in when they arrive
- Clock out when they leave
- Take breaks
- Track hours worked

Managers can view time reports and export data for payroll.

## Scheduling

The **scheduling** system helps you:
- Create shift templates for common schedules
- Assign staff to specific shifts
- Let staff set their availability
- Handle shift swap requests

## Ticketing

**Ticket types** define what you sell:
- General admission
- VIP access
- Group packages
- Season passes

**Promo codes** let you offer discounts:
- Percentage off
- Fixed amount off
- Free tickets

## Check-In

The **check-in** system helps you:

- Handle walk-up guests
- Manage waivers

## Storefronts

Your **storefront** is a public-facing website where customers can:

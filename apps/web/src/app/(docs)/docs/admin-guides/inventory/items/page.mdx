| Masks | MASK-### | MASK-001, MASK-012 |

| Equipment | EQUIP-### | EQUIP-001, EQUIP-023 |
| Supplies | SUP-### | SUP-001, SUP-089 |

Benefits:
- Easy to reference verbally
- Sortable in lists

- Clear type indication

## Location Management

Use the Location field to track where items are stored:

**Examples:**
- Warehouse A, Shelf 3
- Backstage Left Cabinet
- Storage Room B, Bin 12
- Costume Shop, Rack 4

Consistent location formats help staff find items quickly.

## Cost Tracking

Costs are stored in cents (integers):
- $15.00 = 1500
- $1.50 = 150
- $0.99 = 99

This helps track:
- Total inventory value
- Replacement costs
- Budget planning

## Minimum Quantity Strategy

Set minimum quantities based on:

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Usage rate | How quickly items are used |
| Lead time | How long to restock |
| Criticality | How essential the item is |
| Season | Peak vs. off-season needs |

**Examples:**
- High-use consumables: Min = 2-week supply
- Replaceable props: Min = 1-2 backups
- Critical equipment: Min = 1 spare
- Seasonal items: Adjust before season

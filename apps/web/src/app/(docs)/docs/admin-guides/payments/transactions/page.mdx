## Understanding Amounts

### Amount

The gross transaction amount charged to the customer, including:

- Add-ons
- Service fees (if applicable)

### Net Amount

The amount you receive after Stripe fees are deducted:
- Payment processing fees (typically 2.9% + $0.30)
- Platform fees (if applicable)

**Example:**
- Customer pays: $50.00
- Stripe fee: -$1.75
- Net amount: $48.25

For refunds, net amounts appear in red (negative) as they represent money leaving your account.

## Empty State

> "No transactions yet. Transactions will appear here once customers make payments."

Transactions appear automatically when:
1. Customers purchase tickets through your storefront

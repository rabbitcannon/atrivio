# Storefront Navigation

Build custom header and footer menus for your public storefront.

## Overview

Navigation menus help visitors find their way around your storefront. You can create:

- **Header Navigation**: Main menu at the top of every page
- **Footer Navigation**: Links in the footer area

## Accessing Navigation

1. Navigate to your **Attraction**
2. Click **Storefront** in the sidebar
3. Select **Navigation**

## Adding Navigation Items

2. Choose the **Position** (Header or Footer)
3. Select a **Link Type**
4. Enter a **Label** for the menu item
5. Configure additional options
6. Click **Add Item**

## Link Types

Choose from five link types when creating navigation items:

| Type | Description | Use For |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Home** | Links to storefront homepage | Main home link |
| **Page** | Links to a storefront page | About, Contact, etc. |
| **Tickets** | Links to ticket purchase page | Buy tickets CTA |
| **FAQs** | Links to FAQ page | Help section |
| **External** | Links to any URL | Social media, partners |

### Home Link

- Automatically links to your storefront homepage (`/`)
- Label defaults to "Home" but can be customized
- Typically the first item in header navigation

### Page Link

- Links to pages you've created in your storefront
- Only published pages appear in the selector
- Label auto-fills from the page title
- Shows the page slug for reference

**Note**: Create and publish pages first before linking to them.

### Tickets Link

- Links to your ticket purchase page (`/tickets`)
- Label defaults to "Tickets"
- Common for header navigation as a call-to-action

### FAQs Link

- Links to your FAQ page
- Label defaults to "FAQs"
- Good for footer navigation

### External Link

- Links to any external URL
- Requires a valid URL (e.g., `https://example.com`)

## Header vs Footer Navigation

### Header Navigation

The main navigation menu shown at the top of your storefront.

**Best for:**
- Primary pages (Home, Tickets, About)
- Key calls-to-action
- Most-visited sections

**Recommendations:**
- Keep to 5-7 items maximum
- Put most important items first
- Include a Tickets link for conversions

### Footer Navigation

Links shown in the footer area of your storefront.

**Best for:**
- Secondary pages (Contact, Privacy, Terms)
- Social media links
- Help and support links

**Recommendations:**
- Can include more items than header
- Good for legal/policy pages
- Add social media as external links

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|

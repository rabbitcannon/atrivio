4. **Create urgency**: "This weekend only", "Limited time"

### Choosing the Right Type

- Use **Info** as default for most messages
- Reserve **Critical** for true emergencies
- Use **Promo** sparingly to maintain impact
- **Warning** for things that affect the experience

### Managing Multiple Announcements

- Limit to 2-3 active announcements
- Prioritize critical over promotional
- Remove outdated announcements promptly
- Use scheduling to automate timing

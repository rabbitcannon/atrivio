## Best Practices

### Writing Good Questions

- Use natural language visitors would use
- Start with "What", "How", "When", "Where", "Can I"
- Be specific: "What are your hours?" vs "Hours?"

**Good Examples:**
- "What time do doors open?"
- "Can I get a refund if it rains?"
- "Is the attraction suitable for children under 10?"

### Writing Good Answers

- Be clear and concise
- Include specific details (times, prices, limits)
- Update answers when information changes
- Use bullet points for lists

### Organizing FAQs

1. **Most common first**: Put frequently asked questions at the top
2. **Group by topic**: Use categories to organize related questions
3. **Feature important ones**: Highlight critical information
4. **Review regularly**: Update or remove outdated FAQs

### Content to Include

| Topic | Example Questions |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Before Visit** | Tickets, parking, what to wear |
| **During Visit** | Duration, re-entry, lockers |
| **Policies** | Refunds, age limits, weather |

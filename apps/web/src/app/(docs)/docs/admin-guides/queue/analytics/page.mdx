# Queue Analytics

Track queue performance and optimize operations.

## Overview

Queue Analytics provides insights into queue performance, guest behavior, and operational efficiency. Use this data to optimize your queue settings and improve guest experience.

## Accessing Analytics

1. Navigate to **Queue** in the sidebar
2. Click **Analytics** or the Analytics tab

## Date Selection

View analytics for any date:
- Default view shows today's data
- Use the date picker to view historical data
- All times shown in your local timezone

## Today's Summary

### Volume Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Joined** | Total guests who entered the queue |
| **Served** | Guests successfully checked in |
| **Expired/Left** | Guests who expired or left voluntarily |
| **No Shows** | Guests who were called but didn't arrive |

### Breakdown

The Expired/Left metric shows:
- **Expired**: Entries that timed out after being called
- **Left**: Guests who voluntarily left the queue

## Performance Metrics

### Average Wait Time

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Avg Wait Time | Average minutes from joining to check-in |

**Good benchmarks:**
- < 30 min: Excellent
- 30-60 min: Good
- 60-90 min: Acceptable
- > 90 min: Consider increasing throughput

### Maximum Wait Time

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Max Wait Time | Longest wait experienced today |

**Use this to:**
- Set realistic expectations
- Identify peak pressure times
- Adjust max wait settings

### Conversion Rate

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Conversion Rate | Percentage of joiners who checked in |

**Calculation:** `(Served / Total Joined) × 100`

**Good benchmarks:**
- > 90%: Excellent
- 80-90%: Good
- 70-80%: Review settings
- < 70%: Investigate issues

## Current Queue

Real-time view of queue status:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Current Queue Size | Guests currently waiting |

## Hourly Breakdown

Detailed view of activity by hour:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Hour | Time period (e.g., 7 PM, 8 PM) |
| Joined | Guests who joined during this hour |
| Served | Guests checked in during this hour |
| Expired | Entries that expired during this hour |
| Avg Wait | Average wait time for this hour |
| Max Size | Peak queue size during this hour |

### Using Hourly Data

Identify patterns:
- **Peak join times**: When most guests join
- **Peak service times**: When most check-ins happen
- **Bottleneck hours**: High expired count or wait times

## Key Insights

Automated insights based on your data:

### Service Rate

Shows your overall success:
- Total guests served
- Conversion rate percentage
- Comparison to goals

### Expired Entries Alert

If you have expired entries:
- Number of expired entries
- Suggestion to adjust max wait time or notification timing

### No Show Alert

If you have no-shows:
- Number of no-show guests
- Suggestion to send reminder notifications

### Wait Time Alert

If average wait is high (> 60 min):
- Current average wait
- Suggestion to increase batch size or frequency

## Understanding the Data

### Why Guests Expire

Common reasons:
- Notification lead time too short
- Guests wandered too far
- Expiry window too short
- Guests didn't see notification

**Solutions:**
- Increase notification lead time
- Increase expiry window
- Improve notification visibility
- Add reminder notifications

### Why Guests Leave

Common reasons:
- Wait time too long
- Changed plans
- Found alternative activity
- Queue position not visible

**Solutions:**
- Reduce wait times
- Provide accurate estimates
- Keep guests informed
- Offer queue status updates

### Why No Shows Happen

Common reasons:
- Left the venue
- Didn't receive notification
- Couldn't find entrance
- Technical issues

**Solutions:**
- Verify phone numbers
- Check notification delivery
- Improve wayfinding
- Staff stationed at entrance

## Using Analytics for Optimization

### Daily Review

1. Check conversion rate
2. Review expired/no-show counts
3. Identify peak hours
4. Note average wait times

### Weekly Analysis

1. Compare daily trends
2. Identify busy vs. slow days
3. Correlate with events or weather
4. Adjust settings for patterns

### Setting Adjustments

Based on analytics:

| Issue | Adjustment |
|-------|------------|
| High expired count | Increase expiry time |
| High no-show count | Earlier notification lead |
| Long wait times | Increase batch size/frequency |
| Low join count | Marketing, better QR placement |
| Peak hour issues | Extra staff, faster processing |

## Exporting Data

Analytics data can be exported for:
- Operational reporting
- Trend analysis
- Capacity planning
- Performance reviews

Contact your administrator for bulk export options.

## Comparing Dates

To compare performance:
1. Note metrics for one date
2. Switch to comparison date
3. Compare key metrics
4. Identify trends or anomalies

## Best Practices

### Daily Monitoring

- Check analytics at end of each day
- Note any unusual patterns
- Document operational issues

### Continuous Improvement

- Make small setting adjustments
- Monitor impact in analytics
- Iterate based on data

### Setting Goals

- Target conversion rate (e.g., 85%)
- Maximum acceptable wait time
- Minimum guests served per hour

## Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing

- Queue may not have been active
- Check selected date
- Verify queue was enabled

### Unexpected Patterns

- Check for operational issues
- Review setting changes
- Consider external factors

### Data Not Updating

- Refresh the page
- Check queue status
- Verify entries are being processed

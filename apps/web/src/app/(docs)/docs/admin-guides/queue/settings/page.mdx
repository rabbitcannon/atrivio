# Queue Settings

Configure virtual queue behavior and guest experience.

## Overview

Queue settings control how the virtual queue operates, including capacity, timing, notifications, and guest options.

## Accessing Settings

1. Navigate to **Queue** in the sidebar
2. Click **Settings** or the Settings tab

## Queue Status Control

### Enable Virtual Queue

Toggle the queue on or off:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Enable Virtual Queue | When on, guests can join the queue |

**Actions:**
- **Enable Queue** - Activate the queue and start accepting guests
- **Disable Queue** - Deactivate the queue completely

### Pause Queue

Temporarily stop accepting new guests:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Pause Queue | Stop new entries while preserving existing ones |

Use pause when:
- Taking a break
- Handling an issue
- Queue is too long
- Need to catch up

**Note:** Pausing does not affect guests already in the queue. They continue to be processed normally.

## Capacity Settings

Configure how many guests can be processed:

### Guests Per Batch

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Guests Per Batch | 10 | 1-100 | Number of guests called in each batch |

**How to set:**
- Match your attraction's throughput capacity
- Account for no-shows (set slightly higher)
- Consider party size averages

### Batch Interval

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Batch Interval | 15 min | 1-60 min | Time between automatic batch calls |

**How to set:**
- Based on average experience duration
- Allow time for guests to arrive
- Balance wait time vs. queue length

### Maximum Queue Size

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Max Queue Size | 500 | 1-10000 | Maximum parties in queue |

When the queue reaches maximum size:
- New guests see "Queue Full" message
- Existing guests are not affected
- Queue reopens when entries are processed

### Maximum Wait Time

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Max Wait Time | 120 min | 15-480 min | Entries expire after this time |

**Purpose:**
- Prevent stale entries
- Ensure accurate wait estimates
- Keep queue moving

## Notification Settings

Configure how guests are notified:

### Notification Lead Time

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Notification Lead | 10 min | 1-60 min | How early to send "approaching" notification |

**Notification flow:**
1. Guest receives "approaching" notification (lead time before their turn)
2. Guest prepares to head to entrance
3. Guest receives "called" notification
4. Expiry timer starts

### Expiry Time

| Setting | Default | Range | Description |
|---------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Expiry Time | 15 min | 1-60 min | Window for guests to arrive after being called |

**Balance:**
- Too short: Guests can't reach entrance in time
- Too long: Called guests block queue flow

**Recommendation:** Consider distance from waiting areas to entrance.

## Guest Options

Configure guest experience settings:

### Require Check-In

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Require Check-In | On | Guests must check in at entrance |

When enabled:
- Called guests must present their code
- Staff scans or manually checks in
- Entry marked complete only after check-in

When disabled:
- Entries automatically complete after expiry window
- Less accurate tracking
- Useful for self-service scenarios

### Allow Rejoin

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Allow Rejoin | Off | Allow expired guests to rejoin |

When enabled:
- Guests whose entry expired can join again
- They go to the back of the queue
- Useful for forgiving policies

When disabled:
- Expired means done for the day
- Encourages punctuality
- Prevents queue gaming

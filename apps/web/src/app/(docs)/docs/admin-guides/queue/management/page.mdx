## Managing Entries

To call a guest outside the automatic batch:

1. Find the waiting entry
2. Click **Call Guest**
3. Guest receives notification
4. Status changes to Called

### Mark as No Show

If a called guest doesn't arrive:

1. Find the Called entry
2. Click **No Show**
3. Entry is marked and removed from active queue

### Remove an Entry

To remove a guest from the queue:

1. Find the entry
2. Click **Remove**

## Status Flow

Understanding how entries move through statuses:

```
Joined Queue
     ↓
  Waiting (in queue, awaiting turn)
     ↓
  Notified (approaching turn, notified via SMS)
     ↓
  Called (turn arrived, must proceed)
     ↓
  ┌─────────────────┬────────────────┐
  ↓                 ↓                ↓
Checked In     Expired          No Show
(success)    (didn't arrive)  (manually marked)
```

## Batch Processing

The system automatically calls guests in batches:

1. **Capacity Per Batch** determines how many guests are called at once
2. **Batch Interval** sets time between automatic calls
3. System notifies guests before their turn

Manual calls do not affect the batch schedule.

## Search and Filter

### Finding a Specific Guest

1. Use the search box
2. Search by:
   - Guest name
   - Phone number
   - Queue code

### Viewing by Time

Entries are sorted by join time (oldest first by default). The Wait Time column helps identify guests who have been waiting longest.

## Handling Common Scenarios

### Guest Can't Find Their Code

1. Search by phone number
2. Verify guest identity
3. Manually check them in

### Large Party Arriving

1. Verify all party members are present
2. Check in the entry
3. Party size is recorded in analytics

### Guest Needs More Time

1. Find their Called entry
2. The expiry timer continues
3. Consider pausing the queue if needed

### Wrong Contact Info

1. Guest must rejoin with correct info
2. Remove the old entry
3. Direct guest to QR code to rejoin

## Empty Queue State

When the queue is empty:
- Dashboard shows zero waiting
- "No entries" message displays
- Automatic batch calls pause until guests join

## Real-Time Updates

The queue management page updates in real-time:
- New entries appear automatically
- Status changes reflect immediately
- Stats update as guests are processed

## Best Practices

### Efficient Processing

- Process guests in order when possible
- Use batch calls to manage flow
- Check in guests promptly to maintain accuracy

### Guest Experience

- Be ready when guests arrive after being called
- Have clear signage for queue check-in
- Train staff on the check-in process

### Monitoring

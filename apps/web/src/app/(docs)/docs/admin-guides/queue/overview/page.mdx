# Virtual Queue Overview

Manage guest wait times with virtual queue technology.

## Overview

The Virtual Queue system allows guests to reserve their place in line without physically waiting. Guests join the queue via their phone and receive notifications when it's their turn.

**Note:** Virtual Queue is an Enterprise-tier feature.

## Accessing Queue Management

Navigate to **Queue** in the sidebar to access the virtual queue dashboard.

## Dashboard

The queue dashboard provides a real-time overview of queue activity.

|--------|-------------|

| Next Batch | Countdown to next batch call |

### Queue Status

The status badge shows the current queue state:

| Status | Badge | Description |

## How the Queue Works

### Guest Experience

1. Guest scans QR code or visits queue link
2. Guest enters party size and contact info
3. System assigns queue position and estimated wait time
4. Guest receives SMS notification when their turn approaches
5. Guest receives final call notification
6. Guest proceeds to entrance within expiry window
7. Staff scans ticket to check in guest

### Staff Experience

1. Monitor queue dashboard for current status
2. System automatically calls batches at configured intervals
3. Guests arrive and present their queue code
4. Staff scans code or manually checks in guest
5. View analytics to optimize queue settings

## Entry Statuses

Queue entries progress through these statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Waiting** | Guest is in queue, waiting their turn |
| **Notified** | Guest has been notified their turn is approaching |
| **Called** | Guest has been called to proceed |
| **Checked In** | Guest successfully arrived and was checked in |
| **Expired** | Guest didn't arrive within the expiry window |
| **Left** | Guest voluntarily left the queue |
| **No Show** | Guest was called but marked as not arriving |

## Queue Status Flow

```
Waiting → Notified → Called → Checked In
                        ↓
                  Expired / No Show

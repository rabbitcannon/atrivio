## Ticket Type Performance Table

Detailed breakdown of each ticket type:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ticket Type** | Name of the ticket (star icon indicates top performer) |
| **Attraction** | Which attraction the ticket is for |
| **Sold** | Quantity sold in period |
| **Revenue** | Total revenue from this ticket type |
| **Check-Ins** | Number of tickets actually used |
| **Rate** | Check-in rate with visual progress bar |
| **Avg/Order** | Average quantity per order |

### Understanding Check-In Rate

The check-in rate shows what percentage of purchased tickets were actually used:

- **100%** - All sold tickets were checked in (excellent)
- **70-99%** - Most tickets used (good)
- **50-69%** - Moderate usage (review pricing/marketing)
- **Below 50%** - Low usage (investigate no-shows)

Low check-in rates may indicate:
- No-shows or cancellations
- Recent sales not yet attended
- Issues with check-in process

## Performance Summary Cards

When you have multiple ticket types, three summary cards appear:

### Highest Revenue

The ticket type that generated the most revenue.

### Best Check-In Rate

The ticket type with the highest percentage of attendees showing up.

### Most Popular

The ticket type with the highest quantity sold (may differ from highest revenue if prices vary).

## Using Analytics Effectively

### Pricing Optimization

Compare revenue vs. quantity sold:
- High quantity, low revenue = Consider price increase
- Low quantity, high revenue = Premium positioning working
- Low both = Review marketing or discontinue

### Inventory Planning

Use average per order to forecast demand:
- High avg/order = Group bookings common
- Low avg/order = Individual purchases typical

### Attendance Patterns

Monitor check-in rates to:
- Identify no-show patterns
- Plan staffing levels
- Adjust overbooking policies

### Attraction Comparison

Filter by attraction to compare:
- Which venues drive most revenue
- Performance differences between ticket types
- Opportunities for cross-promotion

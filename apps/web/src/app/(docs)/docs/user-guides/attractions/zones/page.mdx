# Zones

Organize your attraction into distinct areas for staff assignments and capacity management.

## Overview

Zones are designated areas within your attraction where guests experience different parts of the show. They help you:

- **Assign staff** to specific areas
- **Track capacity** per zone
- **Organize scheduling** by location
- **Monitor flow** through the attraction

## Creating a Zone

1. Navigate to your **Attraction** in the sidebar
2. Click **Zones** in the attraction menu
3. Fill in the zone details:
   - **Zone Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Victorian Parlor")
   - **Description**: What happens in this zone
   - **Capacity**: Maximum guests allowed at once
   - **Color**: Visual identifier for maps and schedules
4. Click **Add Zone**

## Capacity Management

### Setting Capacity

Set capacity limits to:
- Maintain guest experience quality
- Ensure safety compliance
- Manage flow through zones
- Prevent overcrowding

### Capacity Display

Zones with capacity limits show a badge:
- **Cap: 10** - Maximum 10 guests

Zones without limits show staff count instead.

## Staff Assignment

Zones integrate with scheduling:
- Assign actors to specific zones
- Track who's working where
- Balance coverage across areas
- Plan zone-specific rotations

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

Use clear, descriptive names:
- "Victorian Parlor" over "Room 1"
- "Cemetery Path" over "Zone 3"
- "Chainsaw Alley" over "Scare Zone"

### Logical Ordering

Arrange zones in guest flow order:
1. Entrance/Queue
2. First experience
3. Middle sections
4. Climax/Finale
5. Exit

### Capacity Planning

Consider:
- Fire code limits
- Experience quality
- Throughput goals
- Staff-to-guest ratios

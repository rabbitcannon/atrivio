# Attractions Overview

Attractions are the core of your organization - they represent your haunted houses, escape rooms, mazes, theme parks, or other entertainment venues.

## What is an Attraction?

An attraction is a single venue or experience within your organization. Each attraction has its own:

- **Zones** - Areas within the attraction for staff assignments
- **Seasons** - Operating periods with specific dates and hours
- **Storefront** - Public-facing website for tickets and information
- **Capacity** - Maximum guests allowed at once
- **Staff Assignments** - Actors and crew working the attraction

Currently, attractions must be managed individually. Bulk operations are planned for a future release.

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

Use clear, consistent naming:
- "Nightmare Manor" (good)
- "NM Building A" (avoid)

### Capacity Planning

Set accurate capacity for:
- Safety compliance
- Guest experience quality
- Throughput calculations
- Staff scheduling needs

### Regular Updates

Keep attraction info current:
- Update descriptions for each season
- Adjust capacity based on experience
- Review intensity ratings annually

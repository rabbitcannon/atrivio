# Seasons

Define operating periods for your attraction with date ranges and status tracking.

## Overview

Seasons represent distinct operating periods for your attraction. They help you:

- **Organize operations** by time period
- **Track performance** across different runs
- **Plan ahead** for upcoming seasons
- **Archive history** of past seasons

Common examples include Halloween season, Christmas events, or summer operating periods.

## Creating a Season

2. Click **Seasons** in the attraction menu
3. Fill in the season details:
   - **Season Name**: Descriptive name (e.g., "Halloween 2024")
   - **Year**: The year this season occurs
   - **Start Date**: When the season begins
   - **End Date**: When the season ends
4. Click **Add Season**

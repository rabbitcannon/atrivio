### Naming Conventions

- Keep names short but descriptive

**Good Names:**

- North Gate
- VIP Check-In
- Building A - Entry 1

**Poor Names:**
- Station 1
- New Station
- Test

### Location Descriptions

Provide helpful context:
- Building or area
- Gate number
- Nearby landmarks
- Special notes

**Examples:**
- "Main building, front doors"
- "North parking lot entrance"
- "VIP tent, left side"

### Device IDs

Use for hardware tracking:
- Scanner serial numbers
- Tablet identifiers
- Kiosk numbers

This helps with:
- Troubleshooting hardware issues
- Tracking equipment location
- Maintenance records

### Station Assignment

Consider assigning stations based on:
- Physical location
- Staff shifts
- Traffic patterns
- Special events

### Multiple Attractions

Each attraction has its own stations:
- Switch attractions using the dropdown
- Stations are scoped to the selected attraction
- Staff should know their assigned attraction and station

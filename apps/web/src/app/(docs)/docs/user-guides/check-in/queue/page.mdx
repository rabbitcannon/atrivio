## Accessing the Queue

1. Navigate to **Check-In** in the sidebar
2. Click **Queue**
3. Select your attraction from the dropdown

## Queue Statistics

At the top of the page, three summary cards show:

| Arriving Soon | Clock (blue) | Guests expected in the next 30 minutes |
| Pending Today | Users (gray) | All guests not yet checked in |
| Late Arrivals | Warning (red) | Guests past their scheduled time |

## Guest Statuses

## Queue Tabs

## Overview

The check-in system allows staff to quickly validate tickets using barcode scanners or mobile devices. Each scan verifies the ticket and updates capacity tracking in real-time.

## Getting Started

### Access the Scanner

1. Navigate to **Check-In** → **Scan**
2. Select your check-in station (if multiple)
3. The scanner interface will open

### Scanner Options

- **Camera Scan**: Use device camera to scan QR codes
- **Manual Entry**: Type ticket code manually
- **Hardware Scanner**: Connect USB barcode scanner

## Scanning Process

### Valid Ticket

When a ticket scans successfully:

1. ✅ Green confirmation appears
2. Guest name displayed
3. Ticket details shown
4. Entry recorded automatically

### Invalid Ticket

If a ticket fails validation:

1. ❌ Red error displayed
2. Error reason shown:
   - Already used
   - Wrong date/time
   - Expired
   - Not found
3. Follow error handling procedures

## Ticket Validation

The system checks:

| Check | Description |

| Valid Code | Ticket exists in system |
| Not Used | Hasn't been scanned before |
| Correct Date | Valid for today's date |
| Correct Time | Within valid time window |
| Not Cancelled | Order wasn't refunded |

## Handling Issues

### Already Scanned

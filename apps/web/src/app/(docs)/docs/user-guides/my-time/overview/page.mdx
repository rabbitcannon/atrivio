## Common Questions

### Can I edit my time entries?

No, staff members cannot directly edit time entries. If you need a correction:
1. Note the date and issue
2. Contact your manager or HR
3. They can make adjustments in the system

### What if I forgot to clock out?

Contact your manager immediately. They can:
- Manually add a clock-out time
- Adjust the entry as needed

### Why is my entry still "Pending"?

Time entries require manager approval before they're finalized. This is normal and entries are typically approved within 24-48 hours.

### Can I clock in from my phone?

Yes, the platform is mobile-friendly. You can clock in and out from any device with a web browser.

### What counts as break time?

Unpaid break time includes:
- Meal breaks (lunch, dinner)
- Extended personal breaks
- Any time you're not actively working

Short breaks (bathroom, water) typically don't need to be recorded.

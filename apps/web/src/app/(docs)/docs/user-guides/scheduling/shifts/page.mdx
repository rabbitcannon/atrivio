## Shift List

The shift list displays all scheduled shifts with key information:

| Date | Shift date |
| Time | Start and end times |
| Role | Assigned role with color indicator |
| Staff | Assigned staff member (if any) |
| Status | Current shift status |
| Actions | Edit, delete, and quick actions |

## Creating a Shift

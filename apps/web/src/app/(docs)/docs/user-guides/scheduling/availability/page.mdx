# Staff Availability

Manage when staff members are available to work.

## Overview

The availability system allows staff to indicate when they can work, and helps managers create schedules that respect these preferences.

## Setting Your Availability

### Weekly Availability

Staff can set their recurring weekly availability:

1. Navigate to **Schedule** → **My Availability**
2. For each day of the week:
   - Toggle whether you're available
   - Set your available hours
3. Click **Save Availability**

### Specific Date Availability

For specific dates (vacations, appointments):

1. Go to **Schedule** → **My Availability**
2. Click on the calendar date
3. Mark as **Unavailable** or set specific hours
4. Add an optional note
5. Save your changes

## Availability Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Available | Can work any time during business hours |
| Partial | Available only during specific hours |
| Unavailable | Cannot work this day |
| Preferred | Would like to work (but not required) |

## Manager Features

### Viewing Team Availability

Managers can see:
- Team availability calendar

- Send shift swap requests
- Mark shifts as mandatory

## Shift Swaps

### Requesting a Swap

If you can't work an assigned shift:

1. Click on the shift
2. Select **Request Swap**
3. The system shows eligible staff
4. Select who to request
5. Wait for approval

### Approving a Swap

When you receive a swap request:

1. Review the shift details
2. Check your availability
3. Accept or decline the request
4. Manager approval may be required

## Time-Off Requests

### Submitting a Request

1. Go to **Schedule** → **Time Off**
2. Click **Request Time Off**
3. Select the dates
4. Choose request type (vacation, sick, personal)
5. Add notes if needed
6. Submit for approval

### Request Status

- **Pending**: Awaiting manager review
- **Approved**: Time off confirmed
- **Denied**: Request not approved (with reason)

## Best Practices

1. **Keep availability updated**: Submit changes at least 2 weeks in advance
2. **Communicate early**: Request time off as soon as you know
3. **Be flexible**: The more availability, the more shifts you'll get
4. **Check regularly**: Review your schedule weekly

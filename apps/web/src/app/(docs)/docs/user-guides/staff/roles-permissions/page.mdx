## Changing Roles

To change someone's role:

1. Go to **Staff** → select the person
2. Click **Change Role**
3. Select the new role
4. Click **Confirm**

> **Important:** Demoting someone removes their access immediately. Make sure to communicate the change.

## Best Practices

1. **Start with minimal access** - Upgrade roles as needed rather than starting high
2. **Use specific roles** - HR for HR tasks, Finance for finance, etc.
3. **Review regularly** - Audit roles quarterly
4. **Document changes** - Keep track of who has what access

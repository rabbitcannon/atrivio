## 📊 Progress Overview

**Phase Planning**: Use appropriate number of phases for task complexity (2-8 phases typical)
- **Simple tasks** (2-3 phases): Analysis → Implementation → Testing
- **Medium tasks** (3-4 phases): Discovery → Design → Implementation → Validation  
- **Complex tasks** (4-8 phases): Discovery → Architecture → Core → Migration → Testing → Documentation

| Phase | Name | Status | Start Date | Complete Date | Estimated | Actual | Owner |

## 📋 Phase Templates (Adapt Based on Task Complexity)

**Instructions**: Copy and modify phase templates below based on your specific task needs. Remove unused phases, add additional phases as needed. Common patterns:

- **2-Phase Projects**: Analysis → Implementation  
- **3-Phase Projects**: Discovery → Implementation → Testing
- **4-Phase Projects**: Analysis → Design → Implementation → Validation
- **5-Phase Projects**: Discovery → Architecture → Core → Migration → Testing
- **6+ Phase Projects**: Add specialized phases like Documentation, Performance, Security, etc.

### 🤖 Agent Selection Guidelines

**Available Agents & Their Specializations**:
- **laravel-architect**: Backend PHP/Laravel tasks, API development, database operations, service/repository patterns
- **frontend-architect**: React/TypeScript implementation, Redux state management, Inertia.js integration, performance optimization
- **ui-designer**: Component design, animations (motion/react), Radix UI components, Tailwind styling, visual polish
- **refactor-architect**: Code quality improvements, SOLID principles, performance optimization, technical debt reduction
- **code-reviewer**: Code quality review, security analysis, testing validation, PR reviews (use in final phases)
- **software-planner**: Documentation, planning, architecture decisions, PRD creation (typically for documentation tasks)
- **screenshot-to-ui**: Converting visual designs to React components (when working from screenshots/mockups)

**Agent Assignment Patterns**:
- **Backend tasks**: laravel-architect (primary), refactor-architect (if optimization needed)
- **Frontend logic**: frontend-architect (primary), refactor-architect (for cleanup)
- **UI/Visual tasks**: ui-designer (primary), screenshot-to-ui (if from mockups)
- **Mixed full-stack**: laravel-architect + frontend-architect (split by task)
- **Testing phase**: frontend-architect (for test writing), code-reviewer (for validation)
- **Documentation**: software-planner (primary), code-reviewer (for technical accuracy)
